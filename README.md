# Tictactoe
Creating a tic tac toe game for human to play against random mover computer
and perfect computer who uses minimax algoritm. But for some reason minimax
algorithm doesn't effect on first move so created theory.py file to create 
best first move to play for perfect computer. Using stats from lots of outputs,
the best first move was the corners instead of center. Give it a go!
