# Tictactoe
Creating a tic tac toe game for human to play against random mover computer
and perfect computer who uses minimax algoritm. But for some reason minimax
algorithm doesn't effect on first move so created theory.py file to create 
best first move to play for perfect computer. Using stats from lots of tries,
the best first move was the corners instead of center. It gives more winning
chances, %99.1 winning stats ±0.3 at %99.9 confidence level and %98.2 winning
chance for if the first move is center with ±0.4 margin of error at %99.9 con-
fidence level too. You can change the import at game.py file, which is now
theory, but you can make it player if you want to see random first move for
genius computer. Yeah, give it a go!
